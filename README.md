# DDA-SINDy-Exploration

## Key Documents:
* __Code/SINDy_AIC__ is the software package I have been working with. __EX_TOY_MVG.m__ is the specific run script that is currently active. Git log traces code development progress.
* __Lab-Book.docx__ has detailed notes on work done with the SINDy_AIC software. Key points are annotated as __comments__ in the document. 
* __2018-09_SINDyNotesQuestions.docx__ is a consolidation of broader notes, thoughts, and questions.

## Best practices evolution
* __git commits__ track code development progress. Code development includes: adding functionality; improving efficiency and customizability; correcting errors and bugs.
* __Lab book__ 
  * Includes background information on the project.
  * Provides details of output, plots, succinct snippets of code changes that accompany code development and data exploration progress. 
  * _Organization:_ Because the lab book is a repository of information of varying detail and importance, the document is structured with Headings that create collapsable sections in the Navigation pane view. 
  * The lab book also records intermediate results, thoughts and ideas, and summaries of data exploration progress. 
  * _Comments_ throughout the document bookmark these higher level results. Comments can be viewed all together in Review pane. 
  * The comments and summaries are intended to make quick scan of project progres easy and to facilitate manuscript writeup.
