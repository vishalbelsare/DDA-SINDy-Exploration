# DDA-SINDy-Exploration

## Key Documents:
* __Code/SINDy_AIC__ is the software package I have been working with. __EX_TOY_MVG.m__ is the specific run script that is currently active. Git log traces development progress.
* __Lab-Book.docx__ has detailed notes on work done with the SINDy_AIC software. Key points are annotated as __comments__ in the document. 
* __2018-09_SINDyNotesQuestions.docx__ is a consolidation of my broader notes, thoughts, and questions.

## Best practice dev.
* I have started moving to git commits as a way of tracking project progress over the lab book.
* Not sure yet what final organizational structure should look like. Feeling it out as I go!
